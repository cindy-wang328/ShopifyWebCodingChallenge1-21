# ShopifyWebCodingChallenge1-21
update: TOO MANY REQUESTS ERROR????????


My submission for Shopify's frontend coding challenge

Instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit

Assumptions: The instructions says "When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're **finished**", so I did not allow them to nominate anything after there have been 5 nominated.

Extra features:
- Included image from the API if it exists
- Saves both the last search and the nominated list in Local Storage so if page reloads they will still be there
- Button text changes to "Nominated", "Max 5 nominations" when necessary
